Models can sometimes struggle to separate the task, expected output, and additional context from a long, unstructured prompt. 
To remedy this, you can insert clear labels to break up and differentiate this information for the model.

Add the labels Instruction, Question, and Answer to the prompt to format it more effectively.
Pass the prompt to the model.
